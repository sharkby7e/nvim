# sharkby7e's neovim config from scratch 
I am embarking on the tumultuous journey of setting up neovim from scratch without using a distribution. This is for fun and learning!

I take ispiration from the following neovim distributions:
 - [AstroNvim](https://astronvim.com/)
 - [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/)

 While these setups are beautiful and easy to use right out of the box, I find myself wishing I knew how to 
 more deeply customize them to suit my needs. I kept running into issues with the configuration, 
 and sometimes would be relegated to just going with the default setups, so I decided to build
 everything from the ground up

## In order to set goals, and keep track of my progress I will use this checklist.
### Functional
 - [x] base options
 - [x] my keymaps
 - [x] package manager (probably [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim))
 - [x] file explorer
 - [x] commenting
 - [ ] lsp
 - [ ] bufferline
 - [ ] completion
 - [ ] which-key
 - [x] toggle-term
 - Packages
   - [ ] bufferline
   - [ ] nvim test
   - [ ] telescope

###  Aesthetic
 - [x] colorshcheme
