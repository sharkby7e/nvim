# sharkby7e's neovim config from scratch 
I am embarking on the tumultuous journey of setting up neovim from scratch without using a distribution. This is for fun and learning!

I took ispiration from the following neovim distributions:
 - [AstroNvim](https://astronvim.com/)
 - [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/)

 While these setups are beautiful and easy to use right out of the box, I find myself wishing I knew how to 
 more deeply customize them to suit my needs. I kept running into issues with the configuration, 
 and sometimes would be relegated to just going with the default setups, so I decided to build
 everything from the ground up

 Looks like I'm actually getting close, now just have to get lsp and completion set up, and then I'm like...good to go on a lot of things!

## In order to set goals, and keep track of my progress I will use this checklist.
### Functional
 - [x] lsp
 - [ ] completion
 - [ ] which-key?(not sure if i actually need this)
 - [x] base options
 - [x] my keymaps
 - [x] package manager (probably [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim))
 - [x] file explorer
 - [x] commenting
 - [x] bufferline
 - [x] toggle-term
 - Packages
   - [ ] ~~nvim test~~
   - [x] neotest
   - [x] telescope

###  Aesthetic
 - [x] colorshcheme 
 - [x] syntax highlighting (tree-sitter)
 - [x] status line

Some creators/videos I'm using along the way!
